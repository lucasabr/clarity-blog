Clarity Blog

This is an in progress blog/social media website I have been working towards on and off for the past month.
I've gotten to a point where I feel like I've learned quite a bit with this project, and while there are many things I would like to improve on and add to here, for the time being I am going to leave this project as is so I can focus on summer school and learning some other new technologies that I find interesting.

While this project was not my first time using NodeJS/React, it allowed me to learn a bunch of new technologies allowing my website to be much more versatile, including Redux, AWS S3 Bucket, Multer/Sharp, Emailer, etc.

Current Features:
-Auth working using passport and express-session
-Passwords encrypted using bcrypt
-Emailer is used to send an email to users allowing them to authenticate the account
-User data stored on mongodb using mongoose
-User Avatars hosted on an AWS S3 Bucket
-Avatars received and cropped by backend using multer and sharp
-Users able to edit their profiles

In the coming months whenever I come back to this project I would like to include the following things.

To Do List:
-Clean up code organization
-Add CSS and focus on making the frontend look nice
-Add a create blog post feature, and a favourites feature that allows users to add their favourite blog posts (of their own or other users) to a list
-A direct message feature (to allow me to learn Socket.IO)
-And much more

Usage of multiple packages in node.js like:

-Express
-Passport
-bcrypt
-mongoose
-Multer
-sharp
-aws-sdk
-redux
-emailer
